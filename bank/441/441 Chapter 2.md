- An *alphabet* is a finite set of symbols denoted by Σ.
- A *string* is a combination of symbols, also called characters, over an alphabet.
	- For instance, strings over the alphabet  include a, aa, aaa, bb, aba, and abc.
- A *formal language* is a set of strings
- The *Kleene closure operator* of an alphabet (i.e., Σ*) represents the set of all possible strings that can be constructed.
- *Syntax* refers to the structure or form of language
- *Semantics* refers to the meaning of language
- A sentence is *lexically* valid if all the words of the sentence are valid
- A sentence is *syntactically* valid if it is lexically valid and the ordering of the words is valid
- A sentence is *semantically* valid if it is lexically and syntactially valid, and had a valid meaning

- A *regular expression* is a pattern represented as a string that concisely  and formally denotes the strings of a language
- A *regular language* is a formal language that can be denoted by a regular expression and recognized by a finite-state automaton. A regular language is the most restrictive type of formal language.
- All finite languages are regular, but the reverse is not true
- In summary, a regular language (which is the most restrictive type of formal language) is denoted by a regular expression and is recognized by a finite-state automaton (which is the simplest model of computation).

- A *formal grammer* is used to define a formal language.
